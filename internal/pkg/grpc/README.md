gRPC supports four types of communication patterns, each suited for different use cases. These communication models leverage Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient serialization and HTTP/2 for fast, low-latency communication.


### ‚úÖ 1. Unary RPC (Request-Response)
- Definition:
- The simplest form of gRPC where the client sends one request and receives one response.
- Use Case:
- Simple database lookups, user authentication, or fetching single records.

Example:

rpc GetProduct (ProductRequest) returns (ProductResponse);

- Flow:

```
Client  ---- Request ----> Server  
Client  <---- Response --- Server
```


### ‚úÖ 2. Server Streaming RPC
- Definition:
- The client sends a single request, but the server sends multiple responses (a stream).
- Use Case:
- Streaming logs, real-time market data, or sending large datasets in chunks.

Example:

rpc ListProducts (ProductRequest) returns (stream ProductResponse);

- Flow:

```
Client  ---- Request ----> Server  
Client  <---- Stream of Responses --- Server
```



### ‚úÖ 3. Client Streaming RPC
- Definition:
- The client sends multiple requests (a stream) to the server, and the server sends one final response.
- Use Case:
- File uploads, IoT sensor data, or collecting telemetry data.

Example:

rpc UploadProductImages (stream ImageRequest) returns (UploadResponse);

- Flow:

```
Client  ---- Stream of Requests ----> Server  
Client  <---- Single Response --------- Server
```


### ‚úÖ 4. Bidirectional Streaming RPC
- Definition:
- Both the client and the server send streams of messages to each other simultaneously.
- Use Case:
- Chat applications, real-time collaboration tools, or multiplayer games.

Example:

rpc Chat (stream ChatMessage) returns (stream ChatMessage);

- Flow:

```
Client <----> Stream of Messages <----> Server
```
